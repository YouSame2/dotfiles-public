# dotfiles

My personal cross platform dotfiles using dotbot and dotfiles-manager

# install

use this command to get all submodules (insert this repos link at end)

```
git clone --recurse-submodules -j8
```

# dotfiles manager

I made and use a gnu stow-ish kinda thing that works on windows and mac to manage my dotfiles in the terminal. For more info on that go check it out and star it here: https://github.com/YouSame2/dotfiles-manager
